You're right! Hereâ€™s the corrected version with the settings configuration details included:

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal.
2. Create a storage account (Storage > Create) with the following settings:
   - **Subscription**: Concierge Subscription
   - **Resource group**: Select the one starting with "learn"
   - **Storage account name**: Create a unique name
   - **Region**: Leave default
   - **Performance**: Standard
   - **Redundancy**: Locally redundant storage (LRS)
   - **Advanced tab**: Enable anonymous access on individual containers.
3. Once created, go to the resource, then to Data storage > Containers.
4. Create a new container (Private access level).
5. Upload a file (e.g., an image).
6. Copy the file's URL, open in a new tab, and note the error message.
7. Go back to Azure Portal, select **Change access level** for the container, set to "Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)," and confirm.
8. Refresh the file's URL to access it.
9. Clean up resources if not needed.

Done!
